# Which Machine Learning Model to use?

This repository is created to help understand **how to think about choosing a machine learning model**, rather than memorizing algorithms.

This repo will grow naturally as more videos are added.

## What this is about

Before picking any model, you should always ask three questions:

### 1. What am I predicting?
- A number → Regression
- A category / Yes–No → Classification
- Continuous vs discrete output

### 2. How is my data?
- Small or large dataset
- Clean or noisy data
- Simple or complex patterns
- Data type: tabular, text, or image

### 3. Why choose a model?
- Accuracy
- Stability
- Speed
- Interpretability

This framework focuses on **decision-making**, not implementation details.
